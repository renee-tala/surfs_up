# Surf's Up Analysis 
## Overview 
We are exploring weather trends in Oahu. This analysis will give the client more information on whether or not the surf and ice cream shop will be a wise investment. Year round business is vital to keeping the store 'afloat' so to speak. 


## Results

Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary 
While people may still surfing in December, I don't believe it will be hot enough for customers to want to get ice cream. It's certainly hotter than winter weather in Northern states. Business will surely take a dip with the change in weather, but I believe it's still warm enough to want some ice cream after a day of surfing. 
This analysis only provides the temperature during June and December. To make a better decision, additional anaylsis on precipitation and wind should be conducted. If possible, checking high and low tides for the best surfing times would benefit the analysis. Temperature is not the only factor when considering surfing, even though it might be for ice cream.
