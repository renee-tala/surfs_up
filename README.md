# Surf's Up Analysis 
## Overview 
We are exploring weather trends in Oahu. This analysis will give the client more information on whether or not the surf and ice cream shop will be a wise investment. Year round business is vital to keeping the store 'afloat' so to speak. 


## Results

Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

* June is clearly prime time for ice cream. December had a max temperature of 83 and June a max temperature of 85; not far off but not as frequent. 
* With fewer hot days in December, business is likely to be more sporadic and slower. The consistency of high temps in June allows us to predict consistent business when it comes to ice cream.
* The bar graphs show different ranges between frequency and temperature on the y- and x-axis' which can make understanding the data a bit difficult. 

## Summary 
While people may still surfing in December, I don't believe it will be hot enough for customers to want to get ice cream. It's certainly hotter than winter weather in Northern states. Business will surely take a dip with the change in weather, but I believe it's still warm enough to want some ice cream after a day of surfing. 
This analysis only provides the temperature during June and December. To make a better decision, additional anaylsis on precipitation and wind should be conducted. If possible, checking high and low tides for the best surfing times would benefit the analysis. Temperature is not the only factor when considering surfing, even though it might be for ice cream.
Another point to consider is what time of day the temperatures were recorded. Were they all recorded at 12pm? Or were these various times during the day? This could skew the data.
